## What is OfficeLife

If a company wants to have a complete 360 view of whatâ€™s happening inside its walls, it needs to buy and configure a lot of tools. There is a tool for every specific aspect of a company: HR, project management, time tracking, holidays and time offs, team management, One on Ones,... There isn't a software available today, that combine all of them together in a simple way.

Not only buying and configuring all those software is a time-consuming process, but it also costs a lot of money - especially for smaller companies with a limited budget. Moreover, most of the SAAS out there have a let's-call-us-and-talk-for-an-hour-before-you-can-see-what-the-pricing-will-look-like-for-you policy, which most people hate and that we refuse to follow.

OfficeLife is born to offer a solution to these problems.

To have more information about the project, check the documentation: https://docs.officelife.io/documentation/introduction.html#what-is-officelife

## Requirements for hosting the software

- PHP 8.0 or higher,
- the PHP's intl extension,
- a database engine: preferrably mySQL or SQLite. PostegreSQL _should_ work, in theory.
- a http server: Nginx, Apache, Caddy, etc...
- We recommend [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) or [Ploi](https://ploi.io) to provision the servers needed to run OfficeLife. Heroku _should_ work too.

## Requirements for development

- Composer,
- Node and Yarn,
- A knowledge of how [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/) work. OfficeLife is a complex Laravel application, with a lot of queues and cron jobs.

## State of the project (as of April 10th, 2021)

We are not yet ready for production. We've been developing this project for more than 2 years now and we are close to launch a beta version. We expect to launch during the summer (sooner if possible, but... life happens).

* If you find any bugs, please file them by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/officelifehq/officelife/issues).
* Please don't submit new big ideas for now. We want to do a million other things with OfficeLife already. However, we seek feedback on the current features and how we could make them more useful.
* We have a documentation portal, that we slowly build: https://docs.officelife.io. It has a lot of content already, but we plan of adding much more before launching in beta.
